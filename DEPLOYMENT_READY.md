# üîê AWS Credentials Refreshed Successfully!

Your AWS SSO session has been refreshed. You can now deploy your backend.

## Next Steps:

### 1. Deploy Backend (Creates DynamoDB Tables)
```bash
npx ampx sandbox
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Create DynamoDB tables (Event, Booking, UserProfile)
- ‚úÖ Set up AppSync GraphQL API
- ‚úÖ Configure Cognito User Pool
- ‚úÖ Update `amplify_outputs.json` with latest config

### 2. After Deployment, Check Your Database:

**Option A: AWS Console**
- Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/
- Region: ap-south-1
- View tables: Event-*, Booking-*, UserProfile-*

**Option B: AppSync Console**
- Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/appsync/
- Select your API
- Use GraphQL queries to view data

**Option C: From Your App**
```typescript
const client = getAmplifyClient();
const { data } = await client.models.Event.list();
console.log(data);
```

### 3. If Credentials Expire Again:
```bash
aws sso login
```

Now run `npx ampx sandbox` to deploy! üöÄ
